# panma-harness — Guide

This guide is the single source of truth for **using** the harness. It assumes you know what [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) is and that you can install/edit files in a project.

Three sections matter most:

- **[Quick install](#quick-install)** — get the harness running in any project in 30 seconds.
- **[Level 1: domain executors](#level-1-domain-executors)** — the main customization most projects want.
- **[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)** — when something behaves unexpectedly.

The rest is reference material for when you need deeper control.

## What it is

A multi-agent supervisor for Claude Code. When the user asks for work that spans multiple independent areas of a project, the harness:

1. **Decomposes** the request into per-area specifications (Designer).
2. **Dispatches** specialized subagents in parallel to do the work (Executors).
3. **Verifies** that the parallel changes are internally consistent (Verifier).
4. **Finalizes** with review, security, and optional repo registration (Rule-Applier).
5. **Iterates** until the work is done or a retry budget is exhausted.

The supervisor is just Claude Code itself, executing a strict orchestration protocol loaded from a skill. There is no separate runtime.

Stack-agnostic by design. What constitutes a "domain" is whatever the host project decides — backend / frontend / data, or service-a / service-b / shared, or any other split.

---

## Quick install

In any project you want to harness:

```bash
cd <path-to-harness-clone>
./install.sh /path/to/your/project
```

This:

- Copies the universal agents, slash commands, and the orchestration skill into `<project>/.claude/`.
- Appends a small "activation trigger" section to `<project>/CLAUDE.md` between markers.
- Creates `<project>/.harness/` for runtime state.
- Seeds two YAML schema-reference templates into `<project>/.harness/examples/`.

After install, the harness is fully functional in zero-config mode: any request that matches the activation triggers will route through it, dispatching to `generic-executor` as the catch-all.

To upgrade or remove later:

```bash
./update.sh    /path/to/your/project   # refresh plugin files, preserve user config
./uninstall.sh /path/to/your/project   # remove plugin files, preserve .harness/
./uninstall.sh /path/to/your/project --purge   # also delete .harness/
```

All three scripts accept `--dry-run` to preview without writing.

---

## How activation works

After install, your project's `CLAUDE.md` contains a block between `<!-- panma-harness-include: BEGIN -->` and `END` markers. This block tells Claude Code to enter harness mode automatically when the user's request matches **any** of:

- 3+ independent concerns (areas, modules, domains).
- Changes that have separate verification commands (different build/test entry points).
- Work that is naturally decomposable into parallel chunks.
- An explicit `/harness-start` invocation.

It does **not** activate for single-file edits, one-line fixes, Q&A, or single-domain work. When in doubt, the supervisor errs on the side of NOT activating.

If you want to force activation despite small-looking work, use `/harness-start`. If you want to suppress it for a request that would otherwise activate, say "do it directly" or "no harness" in your message.

## The cycle at a glance

```
user request
     │
     ▼
  Designer ──── emits per-area specs (JSON array, cap 4 per wave)
     │
     ▼
  Executors  ──── dispatched in parallel, in_background
     │            self-verify (build/test), report back
     ▼
   Main      ──── checks in periodically while workers run
     │            (TaskOutput, TaskUpdate, TaskStop as needed)
     ▼
  Verifier   ──── reads all diffs, checks cross-cutting consistency
     │            (no builds, read-only)
     ▼
  Rule-Applier ── review skill, security skill, optional post-finish
     │            rules, optional repo registration
     ▼
  Complete (or retry up to 5 times if any phase fails)
```

The full state machine — phases, retry budget, worker check-in heuristics, idempotency rules — lives in `skills/harness-orchestration/SKILL.md`.

## Slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/harness-start <request>` | Force-activate the harness for `<request>`, skipping trigger evaluation. |
| `/harness-status` | Print a compact snapshot of the current cycle from `.harness/state.json`. |
| `/harness-stop` | Hard-stop the cycle. Touches `.harness/STOP`, sends `TaskStop` to active workers, marks the cycle `needs_user`. |
| `/harness-reset` | Zero the retry counter without changing the request. Useful after raising the retry budget mid-cycle. |
| `/harness-iterate` | Internal — fired by `/loop` dynamic mode at each iteration. Not for direct user use. |

## Level 1: domain executors

The most common customization. Default behavior routes every Designer chunk to `generic-executor`, which works but is, well, generic. A domain-specific executor lets Designer route the right chunk to a worker that already knows your stack's build command, conventions, and boundary rules.

### Recipe

1. **Pick a domain name.** Short, lowercase, hyphen-separated. Whatever maps to a coherent area of your project.

2. **Create `.claude/agents/<domain>-executor.md`.** The `-executor.md` suffix is required — Designer discovers executors by scanning this pattern.

3. **Fill in the template below.** Replace every `<...>` with your project's reality.

```markdown
---
name: <domain>-executor
description: Implements changes within the <domain> area. Reads spec, edits within domain boundaries, runs the domain's build/test command, reports back.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are the **<domain>** executor in the panma-harness orchestration.

## Domain

This executor owns the `<domain>` area. It touches files under:

- `<glob-or-absolute-path-1>`
- `<glob-or-absolute-path-2>`

If a Designer spec implies changes outside these paths, refuse with `status: partial` and a `notes` line.

## Build / Test

After making changes, run:

\`\`\`
<your-actual-build-or-test-command>
\`\`\`

Two-attempt cap on test fixes. On second failure → `status: failed`.

## Conventions

<Optional: domain-specific rules that the host project's CLAUDE.md doesn't already state.>

## Reporting

Use the standard executor report shape from the orchestration skill:

\`\`\`
domain:        <domain>
status:        completed | failed | partial
changes:       [<file>, ...]
build_result:  pass | fail | n/a
test_result:   pass | fail | skipped | n/a
elapsed:       <seconds>
notes:         <free-form 0-3 lines>
\`\`\`

## Guardrails

- Stay within the listed paths.
- Two build/test attempts maximum.
- Implement exactly what the Designer spec asks for; do not expand scope.
- Honor all `constraints` from the spec.
```

4. **Save.** Designer picks it up on the next cycle — no restart needed.

### How Designer routes to it

Designer reads each `*-executor.md` file's `description` field and matches it to the chunks it decomposes the user request into. As long as your description plausibly covers what a chunk is about, that chunk gets routed to your executor. Chunks with no plausible match fall through to `generic-executor`.

### Tips

- **Keep `tools` minimal** for safety. A read-only verifier or a doc-only executor probably doesn't need `Edit, Write, Bash`.
- **Keep `description` factual**. Designer matches on real responsibilities, not aspirations.
- **Path boundaries matter.** Without them, two executors can step on each other's files within one cycle.

## Level 2: optional configs

### 2.1 Auto repo registration

When a cycle creates new top-level directories, rule-applier can propose registering them as new GitHub repos under your org. To enable:

```bash
cp .harness/examples/repo-registration.yaml.example .harness/repo-registration.yaml
```

Then edit the file. Every field is documented inline. Key points:

- **`default_org`** is your GitHub org or user.
- **`default_private: true`** means new repos default to private. Override per entry in `overrides`.
- **`patterns`** uses a dir glob to derive the repo name. `{name}` expands to the last segment of the matched dir.
- **`overrides`** are exact-path exceptions that win over patterns.

At cycle finalization, rule-applier reports proposals to Main, which asks you to confirm. Only on confirmation does it run `gh repo create`, init/push, and update parent `.gitignore`.

### 2.2 Post-finish rules

Project-specific finishers (formatters, linters with `--fix`, changelog updaters, free-form checks) that run after the universal `review` and `security-review` skills. To enable:

```bash
cp .harness/examples/post-finish.md.example .harness/post-finish.md
```

Each rule has a `kind`:

- **`shell`** runs a command. Deterministic fixers (formatter, `eslint --fix`, etc.) apply directly. If the command would touch many files, rule-applier proposes before applying.
- **`check`** is a free-form description. Rule-applier reads the diff and reports findings — never modifies code.

The `scope` field on `shell` rules limits the command's reach: `changed-files-only`, `whole-tree`, or a glob like `"src/**"`.

### 2.3 Skip rules

A JSON array of rule names to skip silently. Default rules are `review` and `security-review`; custom rules are whatever you named them in `post-finish.md`.

```bash
echo '["review", "security-review"]' > .harness/skip-rules.json
```

No example file needed — the format is the one line above.

## Inspecting state

The harness keeps everything for the current cycle in `.harness/state.json`. Useful contents:

- `phase` — where in the cycle we are.
- `retry_count / retry_limit` — how close we are to the hard limit (default 5).
- `active_workers` / `completed_workers` — what's running and what's done.
- `designer_history` — every dispatch the Designer has produced this cycle.
- `verifier_result`, `rule_applier_result` — outputs of those phases.
- `termination_reason` — why the cycle ended, if it has.

For a compact summary, use `/harness-status` instead of reading the JSON directly.

The `.harness/STOP` file is a kill switch: if it exists at the start of any iteration, the cycle terminates immediately. `/harness-stop` creates it; `/harness-start` removes it.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The harness didn't activate when I expected it to."

Two common causes:

1. **Trigger didn't match.** The activation conditions are conservative on purpose. If your request looks like a single-area change to the supervisor, it won't activate. Use `/harness-start <your request>` to force.

2. **CLAUDE.md include not loaded.** Confirm with:
   ```bash
   grep -F "panma-harness-include" CLAUDE.md
   ```
   If empty, re-run `install.sh`.

### "The harness activated when I didn't want it to."

Add a sentence to your request like "do it directly, no harness." The supervisor checks for that kind of opt-out language before activating.

### "Skill(loop) failed to enter dynamic mode when the supervisor tried to assistant-invoke it."

This is the known fallback path. If you see Main complaining that `Skill(skill="loop", ...)` didn't behave like a user-invoked `/loop`, switch to the Stop-hook fallback: see the `harness-orchestration` skill's notes on the Stop-hook alternative (planned for a later plugin version). In the meantime, use `/loop /harness-iterate <request>` directly — it activates the harness through the same protocol but with user-side invocation.

### "A worker has been running for a long time."

Run `/harness-status` to see which worker and how long. Main's check-in heuristics (in the orchestration skill) usually catch genuinely stuck workers — repeated identical errors, no edits, repeated file reads, etc. — and either send `TaskUpdate` hints or `TaskStop` + escalate to Designer.

If you want to intervene yourself, `/harness-stop` halts everything cleanly. After inspecting state, `/harness-start <new framing>` to restart with a different angle.

### "The cycle exhausted its retry budget."

Default budget is 5. When exhausted, Main pauses with `phase: needs_user` and reports the full retry history. Options:

- `/harness-reset` then `/harness-start <revised request>` — start over.
- `/harness-reset` alone — same request, fresh counter (use sparingly; if 5 attempts didn't work, often the framing is wrong).
- Stash the current changes and take over manually.

### "Designer keeps escalating immediately."

Designer escalates when it cannot see a path forward. Read the `reason` field in its escalation output. Usually means either (a) the request is too vague to decompose, or (b) the executors available don't cover the requested work and `generic-executor` isn't a great fit. Either rephrase, or write a domain executor that better matches the work.

### "state.json is corrupt / partially written."

The supervisor trusts `.harness/state.json` as the single source of truth. If a crash or manual edit leaves it in an invalid state, the next iteration will fail to read it. Recovery: delete `.harness/state.json` (and `.harness/STOP` if present) and re-issue your request. The harness will start a fresh cycle. Any actual file changes already made by previous workers remain on disk; Designer will see the current working tree and plan from there.

### "How do I make this work on a private repo on a different machine?"

Same as cloning any other private repo of yours: ensure that machine has SSH key access to the org and the SSH-via-`git` workflow is set up. The harness install scripts don't do anything magic — they just `cp` files locally.

## What this plugin won't do

These are intentional non-goals. Listing them so expectations match reality:

- **Real e2e integration testing** (spinning up multiple services and testing them together). That requires project-specific infrastructure; not in scope for v0. Future versions may add an `integration-test-executor` role.

- **Self-modifying conventions.** The plugin does not change the host project's `CLAUDE.md` beyond the marker section. Convention rules stay where you put them.

- **Background work after the loop exits.** Once a cycle completes (or terminates), there is no daemon, no watcher. The next user prompt is the next conversation.

- **Cross-project orchestration.** Each install operates on one project. Coordinating work across multiple installed projects is your job.

- **Auto-bumping the retry budget.** If a cycle hits the budget, the supervisor pauses and asks you. It will not silently raise the limit.

## Where to look for more

- **The orchestration protocol in full**: `skills/harness-orchestration/SKILL.md`.
- **Each universal role's contract**: `agents/<role>.md` (designer, generic-executor, verifier, rule-applier).
- **YAML schema references**: `examples/*.example` and `examples/README.md`.
- **Issues / questions**: the panma-claude/harness repo.
